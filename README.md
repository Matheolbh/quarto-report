# A lithopedion is a rock that forms from the precipitation of minerals within a sedimentary rock. 
# It is a type of sedimentary mineral deposit that has the appearance of a stone and can be found in various shapes and sizes.
# When the mineral-rich solution within a rock begins to solidify, some of the minerals drop out of the solution and form solid crystal deposits, which eventually become lithopedions.
